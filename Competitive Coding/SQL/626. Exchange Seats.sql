Table: Seat

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| student     | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (unique value) column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the ID of a student.
The ID sequence always starts from 1 and increments continuously.
 

Write a solution to swap the seat id of every two consecutive students. If the number of students is odd, the id of the last student is not swapped.

Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Seat table:
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Output: 
+----+---------+
| id | student |
+----+---------+
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |
+----+---------+
Explanation: 
Note that if the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

Solutions:

1.

SELECT (CASE WHEN MOD(id,2)=1 AND id!=(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seat) THEN id+1
WHEN MOD(id,2)=0 THEN id-1
ELSE id END)id, student
FROM seat
ORDER BY 1

2. 

SELECT 
     ID,
     IFNULL(CASE WHEN id % 2 != 0 
                 THEN lead(student) over ()  
                 ELSE lag(student) over ()
            END, student
            ) AS student
     FROM seat;

3.

SELECT
    s1.id, COALESCE(s2.student, s1.student) AS student
FROM
    seat s1
        LEFT JOIN
    seat s2 ON ((s1.id + 1) ^ 1) - 1 = s2.id
ORDER BY s1.id;
